The original idea was to make an app to control our money for every month and compare them at the end of the month with each other with AI to tell you which buys were nesscesary and which were not and also differentiate priorities of different products, also i had to add different types of themes and languages, but i wasn't able to do all of that beacuse of the complexity and time limit!


App features:
1. Make account with your first name last name email and avatar, avatar can be changed after the account creation, the email used to signup needs to have @ and .com or else it shows errors!
2. You can make an account for admin where you use "admin@budget.com" as an email to sign up and then you have acces to every user details and edit the budget of their accounts or delete their accounts, you can find admin dashboard button at the account page of an admin account, you can refresh the admin dashboard, go to normal homepage or also log out!
3. You can add a budget by clicking the right top button that shows $0.00, and make items by pressing the plus button located in the center bottom of the screen where you type the name and the price of the item which you can delete or edit after creating them, and at the homepage there will be all items list and a calculation that tells your budget remaining, total first budget and total money spent, also when trying to add an item with a price that would go over the budget you would get a notification!

App is designed for phones so make sure you use phone display resolution for best experience!
